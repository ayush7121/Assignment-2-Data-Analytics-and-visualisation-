Assessment 2: Group Project Presentation
 

Due Date: refer to Learnline

Weighting: 30%

Group Size: 4 students (same group as in Assessment 1)





Learning Outcomes Assessed
Unit Learning Outcome 1: Apply appropriate statistical techniques to evaluate data analysis models.
Unit Learning Outcome 3: Justify the process or methods used to analyse large data sets.
Unit Learning Outcome 4: Design and implement a pipeline to analyse a large heterogenous dataset.
Unit Learning Outcome 6: Apply communication skills to present data processing results, orally and in written form.




Task Description


This assignment is a continuation of the data analysis project plan developed in Assessment 1. Building on the chosen data analytic task and justification provided in Assessment 1, your group will now implement the planned analysis, focusing on regression modelling.



This assignment directly addresses the learning outcomes as follows:



Apply appropriate statistical techniques to evaluate data analysis models
You will select, implement, and evaluate regression models using appropriate statistical metrics. Critically, you will justify your choice of metrics, demonstrating an understanding of their statistical properties (e.g., bias, variance, sensitivity to outliers). You will also use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or other relevant tests) to compare model performance and assess the statistical significance of your findings.



Justify the process or methods used to analyse large data sets
You will provide a clear and detailed justification for every step in your data analysis pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. This justification must explicitly connect the characteristics of your dataset (e.g., size, data types, distributions, potential biases) to the chosen analytical methods. Explain why specific techniques were selected over alternatives, considering the strengths and limitations of each.



Design and implement a pipeline to analyse a large, heterogeneous dataset
You will create a data analysis pipeline that includes data collection (potentially from multiple sources), preprocessing, feature engineering (if applicable), model training, and evaluation. The "heterogeneous" nature of the data should be clearly demonstrated, either through the integration of data from distinct sources. Provide a visual representation (e.g., flowchart) and a detailed description of your data analysis pipeline stages.



Apply communication skills to present data processing results, orally and in written form
You will communicate your findings clearly and concisely through a live group presentation (not a recorded presentation) tailored to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Your communication should emphasise the practical implications of your findings, clear explanations of your analytic approach, and defend the originality of your work.





Context Statement
(please refer to Assessment 1)





Step-by-Step Instructions


1 - Dataset Creation and Preprocessing:

Create a dataset relevant to your chosen regression task. The dataset should be sourced from the Avian Dashboard we provided (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/siu.apha/viz/AvianDashboard/Overview) as a primary source.
To score higher grades beyond a Pass, integrate data from at least one other relevant source to demonstrate the "heterogeneous" nature of your data. Justify the inclusion of each additional data source and explain how the data was integrated.
The combined dataset should be of a size large enough to support reliable statistical inferences with regressions. Justify the chosen data structures.
Preprocess the dataset appropriately for regression analysis. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and potentially transforming numerical variables. Provide a detailed justification for every preprocessing step, explaining its purpose and the specific technique used.


2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate appropriate data visualisations to explore the dataset and identify potential relationships between variables. Visualisations should inform your modelling choices. Explain how specific visualisations guided your model selection.


3 - Regression Modelling:

Run one or more regression models relevant to your chosen task (as justified in Assessment 1). Provide a clear and detailed justification for the chosen model(s), explaining why they are appropriate for the data and the research question.
Document the model implementation in Python, including well-commented code snippets and clear explanations.


4 - Model Evaluation and Discussion:

Evaluate the performance of the regression model(s) using relevant metrics. Justify your choice of metrics, explaining their statistical properties and relevance to the problem.
Perform appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or other relevant tests) to compare model performance and assess the statistical significance of your findings. Clearly state your hypotheses and interpret the results of the tests.
Provide a thorough discussion of the model's performance, including its strengths and limitations.
Discuss the results in the original context of your project plan submitted in Assessment 1. Relate your findings back to the organisational context and the specific problem being addressed. Interpret the results for a non-technical stakeholder, explaining the implications of your findings in plain language.


5 - Presentation Preparation:

Deliver a live group presentation (not a recorded presentation) explaining your project, including the data collection, data analysis process, results, and key insights. The presentation should be clear, concise, and engaging for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.




Deliverables


Live group presentation (4 minutes per student), to be scheduled by your campus lecturer, covering:

The project's goals, methods, key findings, and recommendations for a non-technical audience.
Description of the data analysis process, including dataset creation, preprocessing, EDA, and regression modelling.
Evaluation and discussion of the model's performance (e.g. justification of metrics, statistical testing, and interpretation for a non-technical audience).
Interpretation of results in the context of the original project plan, including implications for the organisation.
Discussion of the limitations of the analysis.
Effective use of data visualisation to convey information.
